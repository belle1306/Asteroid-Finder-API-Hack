User flow - 2/5
❌ (-1 point) Sometimes when I load the app, it takes a very long time (tens of seconds to a minute or longer) for all of the textures and such to load in for the 3D objects. This doesn't seem to happen every time, but it is often enough that I'd consider it an issue. I'd recommend (ideally) finding some ways to optimize the load time or (alternative) show some sort of loading spinner until the app is actually ready to use.


Content - 4/5
❌ (-1 point) All of the app's content seems to be coming from a single API endpoint.


Accessibility - 3/5
❌ (-1 point) I cannot seem to access the information about the asteriods when using keyboard-based controls.
